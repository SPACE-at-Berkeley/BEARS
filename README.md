# HoloLens Development

This is the repo for Hololens frontend development.
Currently we are in the phase of implementing the customized UI elements.

## Functionalities

The Hololens connects the astronauts with the LMCC backend, where the Large Language Model (LLM) runs and interprets the intention of astronauts.

By integrating function calling features into the LLM, the Hololens application can get stable string feedback from it through the LMCC and call corresponding functions to generate effects such as overlaying transparent highlights to the UIA image panel.
