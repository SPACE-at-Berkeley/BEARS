EVA Checklist Overview:
EVA Checklist will display all the EVA mission objectives in a checklist style. The checklist will have icons indicating whether a given mission objective is completed, in progress, or not completed. There will also be a minimized view of the EVA Checklist, which will display the mission objective that is currently in progress, as well as the subsequent mission objective.

Check to see if TSS variables are changing to indicate if the objective is in progress
Update the checklist with proper completion status icon, as well as the minimized view where the new in progress task is updated and the subsequent objective is updated
