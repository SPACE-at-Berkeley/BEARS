Function 1: Navigate based on coordinates set by LMCC
Function 2: Navigate based on location set by DE


Store location of user: userX, userY
Store location of destination: destinationX, destinationY, set either by LMCC or DE
Store location of waypoints: waypointX, waypointY, set by DE when walking around
Boolean to store whether there is a path already being generated to make sure the user doesn’t try to navigate at the same time as the LMCC: path - if true, then don’t let another path be made, if false, allow for another path to be made
* Condition (true): destinationX and destinationY cannot be changed (constant while the path is true)
* Condition (false): destinationX and destinationY can be set by DE or LMCC, destinationX and destinationY = -999, -999 (or something arbitrary)
